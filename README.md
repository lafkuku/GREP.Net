# GREP.Net
GREP .Net code repository

This tool is used to execute numerous greps at once and present them in a way that is easy to traverse and look for things. I wrote the tool to help me doing code audits and for other kinds of penetration testing activities like looking for secrets. It has a PowerShell binding as well and you can import/export results to and from the PowerShell and GUI datasets. Itâ€™s pretty darn tooting fast as well. 

If you find the tool useful and create new patterns for other languages or that may be useful to others. Please consider contributing them back to the project.

This tool wouldn't be possible without other awesome open source software such as: 

AvalonEdit
AvalonDock
Caliburn Micro
Microsoft Powershell (Select string backs this).
